MediaLAN 🎬

Local Network Media Distribution System (Laravel)

MediaLAN is a Laravel-based local network media distribution system that allows users to browse and download movies or TV series over a LAN (Local Area Network) using PIN-based access control. Each PIN has a limited number of downloads, making MediaLAN ideal for offline media sharing and monetization in shops, schools, or local communities.

🚀 Features

Users must enter a valid PIN to download
Each PIN supports a limited number of downloads (e.g. 3)
PIN expires automatically after usage limit is reached

🎞️ Media Library
Browse movies and series by categories
Supports large video files
Detects newly added media automatically

📥 Stable File Downloads
Optimized for large files
No session interruption during downloads
Prevents redirect issues (e.g. verify.html problem)

🖥️ Admin Panel

🌐 Network Compatibility

🧠 How MediaLAN Works (Overview)
Admin sets up MediaLAN on a computer/server
Media files are stored locally on the server
Users connect to the same network (Wi-Fi or LAN)
User visits medialan.local
User enters a PIN code
PIN is verified and usage deducted
Download starts immediately
After allowed downloads, PIN expires

🏗️ System Architecture
Backend: Laravel 9 / 10
Frontend: Blade Templates (HTML, CSS, JS)
Database: MySQL / MariaDB
Storage: Local filesystem
Network: LAN / Wi-Fi (Offline-first)

🔐 PIN System Logic
PIN is generated by admin
PIN has:
Code
Remaining downloads
Status (active / expired)
PIN is validated before download
PIN usage is deducted before streaming
Download route does not use session middleware

🛡️ Security & Stability
No session-based downloads
No redirects during file streaming
Separate download routes (Signed URLs)
Prevents PIN reuse or bypass
Stable even on low-quality routers

📶 Network Notes
MediaLAN works best on:
Local Wi-Fi router
MTN 4G LTE MiFi
Internet is not required after setup
Faster routers = better download speed

📌 Use Cases
Media shops
Schools / hostels
Community centers
Offline content distribution
Local monetized media access

🧩 Future Enhancements
